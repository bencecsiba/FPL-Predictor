# FPL Predictor

This a personal project, where I am trying to predict the best team for a given gameweek in the fantasy football game, a game where you select players from the English Premier League and score points based on their performances. 

I have so far implemented 2 random forest solutions and a neural network solution. Neither solution has come near the most number of points scored in any gameweek, but the performances of the teams generated do follow the trend of those picked by players of the game, giving me hope that with further work, I can train a powerful model.

Many thanks to u/vaastav for the data: https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League
